## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Jorge Alejandro Sandoval Romo.

ðŸ’» I'm a final-year Software and Emerging Technologies Engineering student with a passion for web development and machine learning. I love creating interactive, user-friendly web applications and exploring innovative ML solutions to real-world problems.

ðŸš€ My journey has led me to work on full-stack projectsâ€”ranging from dynamic frontend experiences using React and Tailwind CSS to robust backend systems built with Express.js and PostgreSQL. On the machine learning side, I'm constantly diving into projects with TensorFlow and Python to push the boundaries of what technology can do.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm enhancing my skills through hands-on projects, including developing a comprehensive student tracking system that integrates full-stack development with intelligent, data-driven decision making.
